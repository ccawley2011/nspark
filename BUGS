	These are bugs I know about but haven't fixed yet.

	* Filestamping is not supported under 4.2BSD or SysV2 (as no mktime(3)
	  or timelocal(3) functions exist under these systems).  To correct
	  this I could write my own or port the one from 386BSD (save that for
	  a rainy day).

	* If compiled with GCC 1.42 it core dumps when trying to test
	  (or unarchive ?) a corrupt archive file.  This doesn't happen
	  when compiled with the UNIX pcc.

	* The DOS version (and the Windows NT version for that matter)
	  do not time/date stamp directories. (But neither do any other
	  unpackers.)
