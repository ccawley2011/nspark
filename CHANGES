
1.2.4	7th Oct 92	1st public release.

1.2.5	9th Oct 92	Fixed bug in misc.c::riscos_path() that caused nspark
			to core dump under SCO UNIX.

1.2.6	19th Oct 92	Added -x option as an alternative to -u.  Changed
			unix.c::filestamp() so that timelocal(3) is only used
			for SunOS, and mktime(3) is used for all other
			flavours of UNIX.

1.2.7	23rd Oct 92	Minor cosmetic changes... I should really leave this
			thing alone.

1.2.8	6th Nov 92	Fixed function definition for unarc.c::prompt_user()
			(was defined the ANSI C way).

			Fixed io.c::read_header() so it doesn't read the
			load/exec/attr fields if the archive isn't an
			Archimedes archive.
			
			Corrected comments in compress.c about what crunch
			and squash methods were.
			
			Slight change to algorithm in crc.c::calccrc(), though
			no functional changes made.

1.2.9	9th Nov 92	compress.c: Moved offset and size from getcode() into
			global scope so that uncompress() can re-initialise
			them each time it is called.

			pack.c/pack.h: Added putc_init() to initialise the
			static variables used by putc_ncr().

1.2.10	12th Nov 92	Fixed bug with realloc() size in misc.c: uplevel().
			(reported by arb@comp.lancs.ac.uk).

1.2.11	7th Dec 92	Reformatted all source files using Emacs C-Mode (4-
			space tabs etc.).  Slight change to unarc.c::unarc()
			logic when printing file details during unarchiving.

1.3Beta 8th Dec 92	Added -a option to allow filetypes to be appended
			to filenames as they are unarchived.  This is to allow
			Acorn <-> UNIX NFS to work correctly.
			(requested by dhmyrdal@pvv.unit.no)

1.3	9th Dec 92	Changed -a option to -T, made filetypes append in
			lowercase hex rather than uppercase.

1.3.1	9th Dec 92	Changed ret from int in io.c::check_stream().  #ifdef'd
			out write_halfword() and write_word() in io.c/io.h .

1.3.2	22nd Dec 92	misc.c: Changed #include <malloc.h> to
			#include <stdlib.h>

1.4	23rd Dec 92	unarc.c: added total-printing if in verbose mode.

NEW MAINTAINER: Andrew Brooks, arb@comp.lancs.ac.uk.

1.5	5th Mar 93	Added code to compile on RISC OS: mkfiles/acorn,
			acorn.c, changes to io.c, unarc.c, main.c, io.h to
			add prototypes needed.

1.6	20th Aug 93     main.c: Add -C option to convert filenames to lowercase
			io.c: allow top-bit-set characters in RISCOS filenames.
			compress.c, unarc.c: prevent output if in quiet mode.

1.7	20th Aug 93	Added code to read headers from ArcFS archives.
			Changes to io.c, unarc.c, mkfiles.  Added arcfs.[ch]
			WARNING: Code is unfinished: only the list option (-l)
			can be used (and timestamps will be incorrect).  Trying
			to test or extract from the archive will fail, and
			probably dump core.  Please add the necessary
			code if you can, I don't have time at the moment.

1.7.1   4th Mar 94	Fixed many bugs in ArcFS code: changes to unarc.c,
			compress.c also.  Still no timestamps, and files
			extracted are too long by a few null bytes for some
			reason (complen is too large, but why?), so CRC fails.

1.7.2   26th Oct 94	Fixed date and time conversion for ArcFS archives.
			Added manual pages supplied by Duncan (?)
			(m91dps@ecs.oxford.ac.uk).

1.7.2a	9th Nov 94	Altered unix makefile to call ./mkendian not mkendian
			as suggested by Tom Tromey (tromey@busco.lanl.gov).
			Added rename scripts for RISC OS/UNIX.

1.7.3	12th Dec 94	Finally fix ArcFS archive extraction, fixes in
			arcfs.c, unarc.c, io.c and crc.c.  Modifications
			to manual pages to correct errors and add new details.

1.7.4	6th Jan 95	Added Windows NT and Alpha support by Alun Jones
			(auj@aber.ac.uk).
			Restructured directories and added executables for
			RISC OS, Sun OS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.3.
			Added executables for Linux, MIPS and Alpha supplied
			by Alun Jones.
			Updated manual pages for new file formats.
			Added text versions of manual pages for those without
			nroff.

1.7.5	25th Jan 95	Bug fixes in compress.c, thanks to all who reported
			the problem.  Included binaries that report version
			1.7.4 should not be exhibit the bug as it was caused
			by a last-minute source change (mae culpa!).

1.7.6   01th Aug 95     DOS port. (Beta by Bob Brand, bob@wop.wtb.tue.nl,
			or B.A.Brand@wtb.tue.nl, addresses valid until
			at least Oct 1st, 1996), fido: 2:2801/208.2.
                        Removed floating point operation in
			arcfs.c::arcfs_read_header().
			Made htab[] and codetab[] arrays in compress.c
			dynamically allocated arrays (DOS version only!).
			Made misc.c::basename() insensitive for null-
			pointers. (IRIX's strlen() and a few other string-
			functions coredump on null-pointers. Should not
			happen under normal execution. But it can happen
			in the DOS version running under DOS 2.x.)
			Renamed io.h to sparkio.h (conflict with Borland
			C/C++ io.h).
			Removed `Does not support DOS' from BUGS file.
			Added `Does not time/date stamp directories
			under DOS or WINNT' to BUGS file.
			Included executables for SGI IRIX 4.x and 5.x.
			
1.7.7   17th March 1999 -I option Mark Usher, marku@magnet.at
		The -I option has been added to extract the individual
		files with an extra .inf file that contains the
		information relevant to that file. This should help
		people who use BBC emulators to read the files into
		disc images.
		The WinNT directory has been changed to Win32.
